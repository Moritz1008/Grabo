        <h1>About this project</h1>
        <p>
            This application uses a <b>Node.js</b> backend for interaction with a <b>MongoDB Atlas</b> database.
            Both the frontend and backend are containerized using <b>Docker</b> for easy deployment. 
            The host of the Docker Containers is a Fujitsu ThinClient S920.
            HTTPS and subdomain management are handled by <b>NGINX</b>.
            Data persistence is achieved with MongoDB Atlas' free tier.
